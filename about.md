# Checklist bot

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Anna. I do love to watch my progress during issues. I used to use different task managers, unfortunately, they were too complicated for quick notes, moreover, they wanted to be more for corporations with useless functions for wild creators.

Many chat clients have integration with issues and task, for instance, Slack and Jira. We are using Discord at work but it is more for gamers than for workers.

To sum up, I have inconveniences and I want to improve my working process.

## What for did I write this document?
Sometimes in our life, we lose a lighthouse. Days seem grey and we can not find ourselves. Words in this document should support me in hard times and remind me to appreciate my features of a character.

## People are different and it is normal. Do not compare tomatoes with pineapples.
